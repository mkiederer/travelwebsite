  <h1>How I came to Love Traveling</h1>
    <p><center>I ruined my life at 18 when I took a gap year…<br>

        <br>Do I regret it?!
        
       <br> NOT AT ALL!!
        
       <br> Instead of following everyone else’s path…
        
       <br>- I got to experience new experiences
    <br>- I got to travel the world
       <br> - Figure out who I am without anyone else’s input
        <br>- Learned that people judge before seeing the vision you have (aka judging a book by the cover)
       <br> - Learned people would rather give up on their dreams for an “easier lifestyle” or listen to what other people say they should do instead of following their heart
       <br> - Learned that not all my friends and family members are going to support me, everyone will judge you
       <br> - Learned that people who do not understand your lifestyle will judge your life instead of trying to understand it
        
        <br> In the end EVERYONE is going to judge you no matter what you do in life so why not be HAPPY with your life!! Follow your heart! Make your dreams come true and don’t worry or care what others will think! It’s your life to live not theirs!</center></p>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><center>Hi! I'm Max a solo traveler/backpacker, student, and ambassador for two brands. Those brands are Find The Good Brand and EF Ultimate Break. When I was 18 I took a gap year and decided to book a one way ticket to London. From London I went to Netherlands to Paris, France to Switzerland to Italy to Portugal to Barcelona to Germany and then I decided to come home after spending over a month in Europe. The experience and memories I gained were amazing and unforgetable.  </center> </p>
