<h1>About Me</h1>
<center><img src="Aboutme2.jpg" alt="About me pic" width= "250" height= "300" ></center>
<p><center>Hi! I'm Max a solo traveler/backpacker, student, and ambassador for two brands. Those brands are Find The Good Brand and EF Ultimate Break. When I was 18 I took a gap year and decided to book a one way ticket to London. From London I went to Netherlands to Paris, France to Switzerland to Italy to Portugal to Barcelona to Germany and then I decided to come home after spending over a month in Europe. The experience and memories I gained were amazing and unforgetable.  </center> </p>
