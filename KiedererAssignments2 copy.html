    <strong>Max Kiederer- Group Coordinator</strong>
    <p>
        Heyyy! Welcome! I’m Max and I’m coordinating a group to Dublin, Ireland. This is my third trip with EF Ultimate Break and I hope to have many more trips planned! I’m looking forward to checking off Dublin as a destination and touring the Guinness Store house. I can’t wait to have a Guinness and hopefully with you! My favorite destination so far has been either Mykonos, Rome, or Barcelona. There’s too many to choose from and they’re all great in their different ways. Love trying the local cuisines and taking in the atmosphere and culture of the places. I’m <em>#teamwindow</em> when it comes to flying (best spot to take naps or sleep) and counting down the days to departure! Come experience the Dublin City Experience with me from <strong>July 5th to July 11th 2025</strong>. See you there!</p>

    <h1>How I came to Love Traveling</h1>
    <p>I ruined my life at 18 when I took a gap year…<br>

        <br>Do I regret it?!
        
       <br> NOT AT ALL!!
        
       <br> Instead of following everyone else’s path…
        
       <br>- I got to experience new experiences
    <br>- I got to travel the world
       <br> - Figure out who I am without anyone else’s input
        <br>- Learned that people judge before seeing the vision you have (aka judging a book by the cover)
       <br> - Learned people would rather give up on their dreams for an “easier lifestyle” or listen to what other people say they should do instead of following their heart
       <br> - Learned that not all my friends and family members are going to support me, everyone will judge you
       <br> - Learned that people who do not understand your lifestyle will judge your life instead of trying to understand it
        
        <br> In the end EVERYONE is going to judge you no matter what you do in life so why not be HAPPY with your life!! Follow your heart! Make your dreams come true and don’t worry or care what others will think! It’s your life to live not theirs!</p>
